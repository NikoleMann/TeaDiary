# TeaDiary
I really love loose leaf tea but it can be hard to keep track of all the different blends I've had over the years, how I preped them, where I got them, etc. So I'm making this handy dany little app to keep all thos enotes in one central database I can pull up and add to whenever I need.

The plan is to use MySQL to store all the information for each blend; it's name, origin, blend type, where I got it, brew time, temp, description, and my perosnal rating. I'll be able to enter new teas and pull up existing teas by criteria like blend type or rating. The back end will be done in Java and the dront end will use Angular framework with javascript, CSS, HTML.
